  "body": "# Hub Fortify integration\r\nThis simple parser allows for Fortify SSC 4.40 to parse Black Duck Hub security.csv files.  The parsing allows for automating generation of Fortify SSC Issues.  This is a proof-of-concept implementation leveraging some internal Fortify plugin architecture.  Certain manual steps must be done as a one time setup and additional manual steps per process.  \r\n\r\n# Build and Deployment\r\n\r\n### Building\r\nThis is a maven project, dependencies need Fortify jars  that can be found in the /WEB-INF/lib directory within the Fortify tomcatforSSC folder. \r\n\r\n1.  Open the pom.xml files and find the version of the fortify jars.  They will be the 'fortify-public' and 'model' jars.  They can be found in your Fortify installation in the ..\\WEB-INF\\lib folder.\r\n2.  Install the fortify jars into your local repository.\r\n3.  Run mvn package\r\n4.  This will create a /target/ folder with the bds-fortify-integration.jar.  It will also create a target/libs folder that will separate the provided and compile jars.  The compile folder will contain a univocity-parsers-x.jar that needs to be placed on the Fortify class path.  \r\n\r\n### Deploying\r\n1. Download the jar from the [Github Releases](https://github.com/blackducksoftware/hub-fortify/releases) or build from the steps above.\r\n2. Edit the applicationContext.xml file located in ..\\tomcatForSSC\\webapps\\ssc\\WEB-INF\\internal and add the following XML entry:\r\n* <context:component-scan base-package=\"com.blackducksoftware\"/>  (Add this right after the com.fortify entry)\r\n3. Copy the bds-fortify-integration-x.jar into the ..\\WEB-INF\\lib folder.  \r\n4. Copy the univocity-parsers-x.jar into the same ..\\WEB-INF\\lib folder.  \r\n5. Restart Fortify SSC.\r\n\r\n# Using the plugin\r\n\r\n1. Download the security.csv report from the Black Duck Hub.\r\n2. Rename the file to <your name>.log (Currently Fortify does not allow for CSV files and this is a temporary workaround)\r\n3. Navigate to your Application within the SSC user interface and select the scan tab.\r\n4. Upload the renamed security.log file \r\n5. Select the scan tab and you will find your scanned issues.\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n1. Fortify does not allow for the uploading of CSV.  Workaround:  Rename file to <your name>.log\r\n\r\n",
